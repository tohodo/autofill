## Manifest V3 (Dec 2, 2022)

Manifest Version 3 (MV3) is upon us. This might be the biggest change to browser extensions since the invention of extensions. You can read more about it here:

### What does it mean for Autofill?

Since the use of `eval()` will no longer be allowed in MV3 for security reasons, the following things will no longer work in Autofill when it is updated to be MV3 compliant:

1. JavaScript rules
2. Variables that begin with `javascript:`

Autofill will remain on MV2 for as long as the browser companies allow it (no official sunsetting schedules have been published yet, but I'm guessing sometime in 2024). The Autofill codebase is over 10 years old, so there's a chance that Autofill will be rewritten from scratch for easier automation without relying on `eval()` using the latest technologies like JavaScript ES6 [modules](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2021-11/es6-modules/) and ES8 [async/await](https://medium.com/@_bengarrison/javascript-es8-introducing-async-await-functions-7a471ec7de8a). Any updates on this matter will be posted in this space.
