## Lightning Autofill v13.3.0 released (Jan 2, 2025)

As promised, we changed the default matching to be case insensitive, so migrated autofill rules should work the same as in v12 now. For example, in v13.2.0, this rule would fail on the [Practice Form](https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/form.html) because "Fullname" does not match `name="fullname"` since it's case sensitive:

```
Type = Text
Name = "Fullname"
Value = Marty McFly
```

Starting in version 13.3.0, this rule would match like in v12.x.x and earlier since the matching is case insensitive. To force a case sensitive match, you will need to use regex (e.g., `/Fullname/`).

**Changelog:**
- Changed Name matching to be case insensitive by default
- Improved News spacing when loading older content
- Fixed empty News tab beginning of new year
