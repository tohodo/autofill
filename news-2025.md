## Why are my JS rules not executing? (Jun 28, 2025)

ATTENTION PRO USERS ON CHROME: Starting with Chrome v138, developer mode is no longer necessary in order to execute JavaScript rules. Instead, you need to grant this permission in Details:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5542227b-ac2d-484f-a318-9776af775ac6)

If you're not sure where to go, follow these instructions:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click the **Details** button in the Lightning Autofill card
3. Scroll down a bit and you should see the "Allow User Scripts" permission

As a shortcut, you can open `chrome://extensions/?id=nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk` directly. We suspect soon Edge users will also have to go through this permission grant process, so keep this in mind if you're using Edge and suddenly JavaScript rules are no longer executing for you.

## The future is in the cloud (June 26, 2025)

Google finally got back to us regarding why v14 was rejected, and it has something to do with how we're coding the subscription verification logic. We'll try to refactor the code to comply, but this puts us at another fork in the road: we'll probably have to eventually migrate the Options page to be completely server-side. Frankly, this is what we should have done from the very beginning if we'd had enough resources and time then. This is how the big freemium extensions do it (e.g., Loom), and "this is the way" 🤓. Moving Options to the server has many upsides with only one minor downside:

* ➕ We can **continuously improve it** without having to go through the lengthy extension review process.
* ➕ We have **complete control over our code** without having to meet stringent MV3 requirements ([example](https://www.quippd.com/writing/2024/10/16/google-is-killing-uBlock-origin-no-chromium-browser-is-safe.html)).
* ➕ **Better protection** from bad actors cracking the extension, etc.
* ➖ The Options page will be a little slower to load.

While we're at it, we also plan to modernize the UI (finally) so the Options page has the same look and feel as the side panel. Since we're hardcore about privacy, we're going to try and see if we can implement a server-side Options page without requiring user registration and login.

Note that all this won't be happening until version 15, so it's likely about a year away. Until then, we'll complete all the biggest features planned for v14 (data encryption, macro recorder). If Google won't accept our refactored code, we'll release the latest version to the BETA channel. If Google rejects that as well, we'll stop there because we're not going to win going up against a big corporation. In the worst-case scenario, to use the latest features in v14, you'll have to use the Edge or Firefox version (sorry) until v15 with the server-side Options page is released sometime in 2026. If it's any consolation, you always own your own data, and it can be imported/exported between all Lightning Autofill versions without restrictions across all browsers.

## Lightning Autofill v14.7.3 released (Jun 23, 2025)

This is a minor release to address a build script issue that resulted in the v14 submission getting rejected by Google and Mozilla. It also fixes the broken profile menu in the side panel. You should now see the menu properly:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e90d911b-eb3f-48b1-9a53-055dc7b8456e)

### Changelog

- Removed unused fonts to reduce package size
- Fixed build script
- Fixed broken profile menu in side panel

### Release status

- **Chrome:** v14.7.0 submission rejected; will submit v14.7.3 today or tomorrow
- **Edge:** submitted v14.7.3 today (expect to have it approved within 24 hours)
- **Firefox:** v14.7.0 submission rejected; submitted v14.7.3 today

## LAF for Chrome v14.5.4 rolled back to v13.15.2 (Jun 19, 2025)

Google informed us that the review process for v14.5.6 can take up to three weeks. We decided that was too long, so to prevent further headaches for Chrome users, we've decided to roll back v14.5.4 to v13.15.2. Lightning Autofill for Chrome will skip v14.5.6 and go straight to v14.7.0.

**NOTE: v14.5.4.1 is the same as v13.15.2. To roll back, we had to choose a version number that was larger than v14.5.4.**

---

## Switch to Edge for now (Jun 18, 2025)

Version 14.5.6 for Chrome is taking longer than usual to be published by the Chrome team. If you are encountering any of the issues below, please use Edge v14.7.0 for the time being. We'll notify everyone here when v14.5.6 is released for Chrome (we can't submit v14.7.0 until v14.5.6 is released).

### Known issues in v14.5.4

- Some sites are logging users out. This is caused by migration code in v14 that deletes unused data stored in `localStorage`. Apparently when you delete anything from `localStorage`, even if it's your own data, many sites see this as tampering and log you out as a security precaution.
- Manual mode is broken. Even when you are in manual mode, all profiles execute.
- Incrementing/Decrementing variables are not working as expected. For example, the variable `{100++}` would output 102 instead of 101.

### How to switch to Edge

Switching to Edge temporarily (or permanently, considering the increased time for Chrome to release new updates) is a simple process:

1. Open the Lightning Autofill Options page in Chrome and go to the Sync tab (chrome-extension://nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk/options.html#sync).
2. Export your data to a CSV file.
3. Open the Lightning Autofill Options page in Edge and go to the Sync tab (extension://lkfeipbjpgibcbhhciamknhfdpjemfke/options.html#sync).
4. Import your data from the file you created in step 2.

**TIP:** To make sharing data across browsers even simpler, you can do what we do -- keep the CSV file on a server ([example](https://pastebin.com/raw/k5j87pZB)), and import this file by entering its URL into the Remote Import field.

## Lightning Autofill v14.7.0 released (Jun 15, 2025)

From now on, we're going to try a different release strategy because it's not practical to have one store hold up releases for all other versions, so we're going to release the next update as soon as possible. To minimize confusion, release notes will have the status of each version at the time of posting.

### What's new

- In very rare cases your data can be reset to the defaults if there is any sort of hiccup during the extension update process. To protect against this worst case scenario, we added a fail-safe backup that you can use to restore your data (see [FAQ #62](https://docs.lightningautofill.com/faq#q62)).
- We added experimental support for Firefox Mobile (v138 or later required). Please report any issues you find to [Discord](https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LightningAutofill/).
- The "Autocomplete trigger character" option was renamed to "Text expansion delimiter" and moved out of Experimental.
- We improved the layout on the Options page when "Fluid layout" is disabled.
- We polished up the Options page style on Firefox to be more consistent with Chrome/Edge.
- We fixed an incorrect link to a FAQ item on [Lightning Autofill Docs](https://docs.lightningautofill.com/).
- We fixed the broken "What's new" link in Firefox because of a CORS issue.

### Release status

- **Chrome:** v14.5.6 still under review. Chrome team can take anywhere from 24-72 hours to approve, and we can't submit v14.7.0 until v14.5.6 is published.
- **Edge:** v14.7.0 submitted for review. Edge team usually takes less than 24 hours to approve.
- **Firefox:** v14.5.6 submission canceled and replaced with v14.7.0 submission. Firefox team can take over a week to approve.

**NOTE:** Updates are only published and rolled out to their respective browsers after approval.

## Lightning Autofill v14.5.6 released (Jun 13, 2025)

This is a hotfix to address these three issues:

1. Incrementing and decrementing variables (e.g., `{1++}`) were iterating twice. This has been fixed.
2. Manual mode stopped working. This regression issue has been fixed.
3. Some sites such as [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com/) were getting logged out. This bug has been squashed.

## Cloudflare service outage (Jun 12, 2025)

You may be having issues activating or verifying your subscription at the moment because of an issue with our backend provider:

https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/

- **Streamlined subscription management** - The **Manage Subscription** button now signs you in automatically, eliminating the tedious email verification process (yay! 🥳).

### Preparing for Chrome v138

- We've made behind-the-scenes changes to prepare for Chrome v138, which will **finally remove the developer mode requirement** for JavaScript execution. [Read more about this change »](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-userscript)
- Once Chrome v138 arrives, **Pro** members will simply grant the required permission through **Details** instead of enabling developer mode like before. The "Developer mode popup" option will be renamed to "Permissions popup" to be aligned with Firefox.

## Halving Pledge page is live (May 26, 2025)

We just published our [Halving Pledge page](https://autofill.tohodo.com/halving-pledge.html). When we first announced it in the first week of May, the progress bar was hovering a little over 1% -- now it's at 2.75% as of this writing 🥳. This is promising since we haven't released v14 to the main channel yet. If you guys want to hit the milestones faster, please spread the word! 🙏

**NOTE:** The progress data is retrieved from the Stripe API every four hours on the backend. There may be times when the progress bar percentages you see on the Options page vs. the Halving Pledge page are out of sync, since the Options page retrieves the latest data every time you load it, while the data powering the Halving Pledge page is cached for 30 minutes locally.

---

## Lightning Autofill v14.4.0 BETA released (May 23, 2025)

Thanks to the help of some dedicated users, more bugs were slayed in this release, in addition to internal improvements that are not visible. Users on the free tier may be delighted to know that a hard-to-troubleshoot issue where the quota wasn't being reset daily has been fixed.

**Changelog:**
- Improved backend integration
- Fixed JavaScript variables initialization bug
- Fixed edge case where Free quota wasn't reset
- Fixed incorrect profile executions remaining icon tooltip
- Fixed duplicate API calls
- Fixed JavaScript errors from corrupt data

## Lightning Autofill v14.3.0 BETA released (May 18, 2025)

The main addition in this update is a "Sponsored by" link at the top of the Options page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fc74411-a8c1-4bf6-b9b8-cfde9a74d817)

This link is seamlessly integrated without taking up additional space on the page. And of course, there is no tracking whatsoever. Interested in becoming a sponsor? Visit [Lightning Autofill Sponsorship](https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/sponsorship) to learn more.

This should be the last beta release, unless more bugs are reported. So far we've had one report of an import failure, but so far we haven't been able to replicate it. If you encounter any issues with the beta version, please [email us](mailto:support@tohodo.com), or tell us about your issue on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LightningAutofill/), or [Twitter/X](https://x.com/Lightning_AF).

This is a small update to tidy things up. Here's a summary of the changes:

- You can now execute the Unfiled profile when using the AUTOFILL action by leaving the Value column empty. The All profile is still not allowed here to prevent infinite loops.
- The JavaScript rules and variables backend logic was refactored for better efficiency.
- Fixed a regression issue where executing the Unfiled profile would result in the execution of all rules (similar to if you had executed the All profile).

## Lightning Autofill v14.1.5 BETA released (May 13, 2025)

This update is mostly to address various bugs before the final release to the stable branch. We're likely going to publish this to the stable branch sooner rather than later because it contains an important fix for Firefox.

**Changelog:**
- Improved rendering of long profile list in side panel
- Improved import operation
- Updated Halving Pledge messaging
- Updated side panel filter field tooltip
- Fixed import error handling regression
- Fixed iframes not loaded on some pages in Firefox

## One Year Anniversary 🎊 (May 7, 2025)

We're approaching the one-year anniversary of the launch of Lightning Autofill v12 (May 15, 2024), when we decided to switch to the freemium model with the update to MV3. The LAF team would like to take a moment to look back on this journey. When we first started, we could barely cover our operating expenses after living off our savings while working on version 12. It got pretty hairy on more than one occasion, with lots of negativity early on -- a lot as a result of us shooting ourselves in the foot with critical bugs. There were bouts of second guessing ourselves. However, somehow we managed to overcome every challenge, push through every obstacle 💪. Fast-forward a year, and we're happy to announce that today Lightning Autofill on MV3 has reached a level of financial and code stability where we have some breathing room again.

Looking back, we have absolutely no regrets walking away from lucrative offers to buy Lightning Autofill that would have resulted in an uncertain future for our loyal users. Since we are now cash flow positive with the freemium model, we would like to officially announce our Halving Pledge as a way of giving back to the community as well as growing our subscriber base.

### ⭐ Halving Pledge ⭐

We pledge to cut our subscription prices in half every time our number of subscribers doubles. Starting with v14 (see release notes below), you will see a progress bar in Settings / Subscription:

<img width="355" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b515002a-63fb-40e0-bf35-c60e33185fd1" />

In order to make Lightning Autofill more affordable for you guys faster, we will implement these milestone goals:

- When the progress bar hits **25%**, the subscription prices will be reduced to **$4.37/mo** for the Plus plan and **$8.74/mo** for the Pro plan.
- When the progress bar hits **50%**, the subscription prices will be reduced to **$3.74/mo** for the Plus plan and **$7.49/mo** for the Pro plan.
- When the progress bar hits **75%**, the subscription prices will be reduced to **$3.12/mo** for the Plus plan and **$6.24/mo** for the Pro plan.
- When the progress bar hits **100%**, the subscription prices will be reduced to **$2.49/mo** for the Plus plan and **$4.99/mo** for the Pro plan.

The progress bar data is automatically retrieved from the Stripe API every hour. The starting subscriber count is the total number of subscribers at the end of May 1st, 2025. You can hover the mouse cursor over the progress bar to see the exact percentage at any given time.

### Lightning Autofill v14.0.0 BETA released

We've made a ton of changes under the hood, mostly migrating Firefox to MV3 and rearchitecting for the future. Here are the changes that you can actually see:

- A new side panel for your profiles! This will also be the interface for the upcoming macro recording feature, but for now you have quick access to execute and edit your profiles. You can toggle the side panel via the right-click context menu.
- JavaScript rules now have access to global variables on the website, which makes them more powerful than ever. For example, if a site uses jQuery, your rules can also use jQuery.
- Moved the "Parse labels" and "Profile expiration" options to the Operation section.
- **[Breaking change]** The special built-in function `$()` was renamed to `LAF$()` to prevent conflicts with websites that also rely on the `$` global variable (e.g., jQuery). If you have JavaScript rules that use `$()` to reference something in the Variables tab, be sure to update these rules to use `LAF$()` instead.
- A bunch of bug fixes to make for a smoother experience in everyday use.

**Changelog:**
- Migrated Firefox version from MV2 to MV3
- Added side panel for profiles and macro recording (WIP)
- Allowed JavaScript rules access to website global variables
- Changed `$()` to `LAF$()`
- Improved JavaScript rules and variables processing
- Moved "Parse labels" and "Profile expiration" to Operation
- Replaced Autofill Stars with Halving Pledge
- Fixed rare case where only first JavaScript rule executed
- Fixed outdated info in Value column help bubble
- Fixed local data potentially overwritten by empty Sheets
- Fixed edge case where Advanced cloud data was corrupt
- Fixed bi-directional sync corruption in some cases
- Fixed JavaScript error after extension update event

- Fixed rule generation bug after using Back button

- Fixed incorrect badge count when executing profiles

- Fixed UI glitches at high resolutions (pixel ratios)

## Update on v14 (Apr 13, 2025)

We have officially started work on version 14! It will have some major changes, especially for Firefox users. Many users may not know that even though the Chrome/Edge version of Lightning Autofill has been on MV3 since v12, the Firefox version was still stuck on a clunky MV2/MV3 hybrid code base where we have legacy Firefox MV2 code living alongside MV3 code shared from the Chrome/Edge version, mainly because Mozilla's implementation of MV3 was too different from Google's implementation. As a consequence, this setup was prone to bugs and was a maintenance nightmare. Starting with [Firefox v136](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/136), Mozilla's implementation of MV3 has been further aligned with Google's MV3 to the point where the Chrome/Edge and Firefox extensions can finally share the same MV3 code base, which will make maintenance a lot more streamlined.

### Attention: Firefox users

**BACK UP YOUR DATA.**

What does this mean for Firefox users? While we make every effort to test as thoroughly as possible on Firefox, nothing is guaranteed. Hence, you should make a full backup of your data by going to Lightning Autofill Options / Sync and clicking on the Export button. For those who are on older versions of Firefox and don't want to update to v136 or newer, we will keep the last MV2 version of Firefox ([v13.15.2](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/lightning-autofill/versions/)) around for a while to help with the transition.

### Breaking changes

**`$()` renamed to `LAF$()`**

The initial release of version 14, v14.0.0, will mostly include architectural changes to prepare for exciting new features to come (e.g., macro recorder, AI autofill). One of the breaking changes will be to the way JavaScript rules are processed. Currently, your JavaScript rules don't have access to global variables on the web page because they exist in a different "world", which limits the rules' power. Starting with v14, your JavaScript rules will be able to interact with global variables like jQuery's `$()` since they will share the same world. While this is a big improvement, it means the special function `$()` to reference variables in your JavaScript rules will be renamed to `LAF$()` to avoid conflicts with pages that use the `$` global.

## Lightning Autofill v13.15.2 released (Apr 6, 2025)

This is a hotfix release to patch up some recent regressions.

**Changelog:**
- Fixed regression bug with advanced delays
- Fixed regression issues with backup option

---

## Lightning Autofill v13.15.0 released (Apr 2, 2025)

This was originally just a hotfix release, but while we were at it, we added some quality-of-life improvements also.

- Users on the Free plan reported an annoying Google signin popup suddenly appearing. This was a regression and has been fixed.
- On pages with certain types of iframes, actions and JavaScript rules were getting executed multiple times. This bug has been squashed.
- Before, all JavaScript rules were NOT executed in the order in which they were saved in the rules table. Instead, all JavaScript rules were aggregated into one batch and executed all at once after all other rules had been executed. We've always felt this was an inconsistent design and had planned on changing this 10 years ago, but never got around to doing it until now. Now JavaScript rules are executed in the order in which they are displayed, as they're supposed to. Here's a screen recording of a JavaScript rule changing the background color and waiting four seconds before autofilling the "fullname" field:

    🎞️ https://screenrec.com/share/vZrDg97hV6

- Now you can quickly open the code editor whenever the caret is inside the Value column by pressing `Alt+Enter`.
- The text boxes inside the rules table automatically grow and shrink as you type.

## Lightning Autofill BETA v13.13.2 released (Mar 19, 2025)

This update addresses two reported issues:

1. In some cases, input elements that were inserted into the document dynamically after page load via AJAX were not getting autofilled. This has been fixed.
2. If you have two profiles, each calling the other in a circular reference using the AUTOFILL action, the loop would break after one cycle and these two profiles would not call each other indefinitely as expected. This has been fixed.

## Lightning Autofill BETA v13.13.0 released (Mar 17, 2025)

This is a small update that includes some optimizations to bi-directional cloud sync that didn't make it into the previous release. We also improved the rule generation code to prevent potential duplicate profile or rule IDs when adding new profiles and rules.

## Lightning Autofill BETA v13.12.5 released (Mar 12, 2025)

The main highlights in this release:

1. Lightning Autofill's internal CSS selector generator was rewritten to be up to 300x faster. We're not kidding -- check out the [benchmarks](https://screenrec.com/share/CkRjoTDY27). The previous version of our CSS selector generator was called `getUniqueSelector()` and the new version is `genUniqueSelector7()`. All the other functions are from third-party libraries, which either produced overly long CSS selectors or were too slow. You can see how much faster it is by generating rules on [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBeozaGcMlNlh2Zx0_We6weVrp9ivui_enI1vUOo4aOUq5lQ/viewform) with the "Parse labels" option disabled. CSS selectors are generated for the Name column as a fallback whenever fields have no unique attribute values. If a concise CSS selector is not found either, then an XPath is generated as a last resort.
2. Fixed a number of cloud sync issues. For those who have "Bi-directional sync" enabled, the syncing should be a lot more reliable now.
3. Updated the rules generator to work with the latest Microsoft Forms HTML code. Lightning Autofill should now be able to generate rules for Microsoft Forms regardless of whether you have the "Parse labels" option enabled. NOTE: The "Parse labels" option is required for Google Forms with shuffled questions.

**Changelog:**
- Improved rule generation speed when using CSS selectors
- Improved Crowdtap.com rule generation
- Refactored lots of code to modern standards
- Fixed site filter issue in Google Forms
- Fixed new profiles not synced to Google Sheets in some cases
- Fixed broken autofill for updated Microsoft Forms
- Fixed issues with autofilling input groups
- Fixed "Sync from Sheets" button not working in some cases

## Lightning Autofill BETA v13.9.3 released (Feb 27, 2025)

In addition to various bug fixes, we made two big enhancements to cloud sync in this update:

1. Data now syncs to Google Sheets when you generate rules without having to open the Options page first.
2. When you first start Edge or Firefox, you no longer have to go to the Options page to reconnect your Google account.

The video below illustrates this. In the video, we load Edge, and without opening the Options page to reconnect our Google account, we update an autofill rule using the infobar wizard (change value from "aaa" to "zzz"). This updated rule is then synced to Google Sheets.

https://screenrec.com/share/w0jd3QGmse

What's not shown in the video is another improvement to cloud sync: when you have bi-directional sync enabled, Lightning Autofill automatically retrieves data from Google Sheets before generating new rules so that you minimize the risk of overwriting new rules that were added to Google Sheets from another PC or browser (a big quality-of-life improvement for cloud sync users who manage rules in Google Sheets from multiple devices).

If there are no reported bugs for a week, then this should be the last release before it gets pushed to the stable channel.

**Changelog:**
- Improved cloud sync connection process
- Optimized bi-directional sync
- Fixed regression generating radio group rules
- Fixed JavaScript error with sandboxed iframes
- Fixed Google Sheets disconnection bug

### Microsoft Forms update

It appears Microsoft recently updated the HTML code of Microsoft Forms. From now on, if you want to properly autofill Likert multiple-choice questions such as the one below, you need to **disable** the "Parse labels" option when generating rules.

- Fixed broken Google reCAPTCHA autofill. Please retry using this version if it was failing for you before.

## Shutting down for Lunar New Year 🎊 (Jan 19, 2025)

The Lunar New Year is the biggest festival of the year for us. The Lightning Autofill team will be shutting down from January 19 to February 2. Please do NOT send any alternative payments during this time as nobody will be around to process them.

There are two known bugs with BETA v13.7.10 that will be addressed when we return:

1. The generated site filter for `about:blank` iframes is "blank", which might result in unexpected behavior since it's too generic. We will fix this to use the parent frame's URL instead.
2. There are some regression issues with generating rules for certain rich-text editors that rely on inline iframes. This is still under investigation, but we should be able to get it resolved after we return.

## Skip BETA v13.7.9 and wait for v13.7.10 (Jan 15, 2025)

Please do NOT install BETA v13.7.9 because there was something wrong with that package that broke the autofill. Thank goodness it didn't go out to the production channel or it would've been a disaster 😅. I will make another announcement here when BETA v13.7.10 is released. Apologies for the inconvenience!

## Lightning Autofill BETA v13.7.9 released (Jan 14, 2025)

To prevent disruptions for people who use Lightning Autofill in mission critical applications, we have launched a new [BETA channel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oinjpibanhdbgelnjjjffimdlpcfpipa) to test new releases before they are published to the main [production channel](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/Lightning%20Autofill/nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk). This is similar to [Chrome release channels](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-release-channels), and we think it will help reduce headaches for you guys down the road. For those who want to try out the latest changes in Lightning Autofill before it's officially released, or just to help test the extension, please install from the link below. The latest version will remain in the BETA channel for 1-2 weeks before moving to the production channel if no bugs are reported. You can have both beta and production versions installed at the same time.

[Lightning Autofill BETA channel »](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oinjpibanhdbgelnjjjffimdlpcfpipa)

In this update, we fixed a lot of cloud sync issues, so this feature should be a lot more stable now. We also added support for forms that are dynamically created inside iframes using the `about:blank` hack, allowing Lightning Autofill to work its magic on more types of tricky forms. Last but not least, we added the "Reveal password" option to allow you to quickly reveal the password in password fields.

**Changelog:**
- Added "Reveal password" option
- Added support for about:blank iframes (🙏 @turbowells @Aktrading)
- Added link to re-activation instructions
- Added BETA branch for test releases
- Improved cloud sync permissions notification
- Improved SCRAPE to be able to extract text from form fields
- Fixed cloud sync bug with switching Google accounts
- Fixed sync dialog showing after connection error
- Fixed issues when syncing for the first time
- Fixed issue syncing new profile
- Fixed active spreadsheet sometimes not selected
- Fixed issue syncing large data sets (🙏 Markus)
- Fixed cross-origin JavaScript error
- Fixed incorrect help text on case sensitivity

## Lightning Autofill v13.3.0 released (Jan 2, 2025)

As promised, we changed the default matching to be case insensitive, so migrated autofill rules should work the same as in v12 now. For example, in v13.2.0, this rule would fail on the [Practice Form](https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/form.html) because "Fullname" does not match `name="fullname"` since it's case sensitive:

```
Type = Text
Name = "Fullname"
Value = Marty McFly
```

Starting in version 13.3.0, this rule would match like in v12.x.x and earlier since the matching is case insensitive. To force a case sensitive match, you will need to use regex (e.g., `/Fullname/`).

**Changelog:**
- Changed Name matching to be case insensitive by default
- Improved News spacing when loading older content
- Fixed empty News tab beginning of new year
