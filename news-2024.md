## Lightning Autofill v12.0.3 released (May 16, 2024)

This is a hotfix to address some Edge issues that only surfaced after the extension was published (these issues are not reproducible in local testing, hence they were not caught). Changelog:

- Fixed Support and News tabs having no content in Edge
- Fixed "No tab with id" error in some cases
- Removed some unused code from v11

**UPDATE:** After v12.0.3 was released, I was still getting reports of the Options page being blank in Edge even though it was working fine for me. After digging some more, I identified the real root cause: sadly, Chrome and Edge require you to enable Developer mode in order to execute JavaScript rules in MV3:

This explains why I was not able to reproduce the issue (because I'm always in Developer mode, which is required to develop and test extensions locally). I still can't wrap my head around why they introduced such a silly requirement, but I'll go along with it. I will update both Chrome and Edge versions to add instructions on how to enable Developer mode and republish. Sorry for the troubles! üôè

## üéä Lightning Autofill v12.0.0 released üéâ (May 15, 2024)

After 118 commits over three months, countless improvements, refactoring and bug fixes, Lightning Autofill version 12 has finally been released! It may not look like it on the outside, but underneath this is the biggest release since version 1.0. Let's go over the major changes:

- **Migrated to [Manifest V3 (MV3)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3).** MV2 extensions will be deprecated this June, so this move was unavoidable. Upgrading to MV3 was a royal pain, but it also makes extensions more secure and future-proof. Unfortunately, Mozilla's MV3 implementation is too different from Google's, so Firefox continues to exist as an MV2 add-on until it reaches full MV3 feature parity with Chrome/Edge extensions.
- **Switched to freemium model.** I anticipate this to be an unpopular change after 14 years of being completely free, but it was a necessary change for the continued survival of Lightning Autofill. I've had opportunities to sell this extension in the past, but I read about what can happen to users after an extension is sold ([exhibit A](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-great-suspender-chrome-extensions-fall-from-grace/), [exhibit B](https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom/discussions/670), [exhibit C](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/malware-vendors-buy-chrome-extensions-to-send-adware-filled-updates/)), and didn't want to put you guys at risk, so here we are.
- **Implemented cloud sync.** You can now manage your autofill rules in Google Sheets, which opens up a world of possibilities. I've been meaning to add this feature for years since I manage so much data in Sheets already, and I also automate a lot of workflows with [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/). Unfortunately, there's no way for Google Sheets to communicate with extensions right now, so when you make an edit in Sheets you have to click on the Restore button from Lightning Autofill Options to pull in the changes. Changes in Lightning Autofill are automatically synced to Sheets though.
- **Added support for `autocomplete` attribute.** This was a small change with big implications. Since [this attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) has become so prevalent, you now have the capability to create more reliable global address rules. In fact, Lightning Autofill v12 comes with sample address rules that you can modify for your own needs. For existing users who are updating to v12, you can import the address rules using remote import from this URL: https://pastebin.com/raw/Rk42q0cv (NOTE: remember to choose the "Append" option or these rules will overwrite your existing rules).
- You can see the full list of changes in the [changelog](https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/changelog.txt).

Since so much of the code was rewritten, and the extension migrated from MV2 to MV3, I expect the review process to be longer than usual, possibly over a week, so hang on tight. I'll post another announcement when it's published and starts rolling out to Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

### How to activate your plan

Once Lightning Autofill has been updated to v12, you will see a new **Subscription** section in **Options ‚Üí Settings**:

This is where you enter the invoice number to activate your subscription plan.

### Bye bye, Wallu

After monitoring the `#ask-ai` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD) for awhile, it's clear that the CommunityOne bot gives consistently better quality responses than Wallu AI. Hence, I will give Wallu early retirement and keep only CommunityOne in the channel. Having two bots answer at the same time can be confusing as well, so this is a good change.

### Hello, LightningAutofillPro

Even though we have the `#ask-ai` channel, the best helpdesk chatbot is actually the one I trained on Poe: [LightningAutofillPro](https://poe.com/LightningAutofillPro). I recommend everyone consult with LightningAutofillPro for the following reasons:

- It's private. Everybody can see what you ask in the `#ask-ai` channel, so if you want to ask about something personal or confidential, then ask LightningAutofillPro.
- It's based on a newer, better LLM. CommunityOne is powered by [GPT-3.5](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/). LightningAutofillPro is powered by [Claude-3](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family), which is generally better across the board.
- Your chat sessions are saved. Once you register for a free account, you will have a history of everything that you ever asked LightningAutofillPro.
- You can bookmark it. No need to be logged into Discord.

## Introducing LightningAutofillPro Poe bot (May 11, 2024)

I just created my first bot on Poe, and after lots of testing it seems to provide [superior responses](https://poe.com/s/BPEpOlsTWvmfEcn1FjY9) to both CommunityOne and Wallu AI Discord bots. LightningAutofillPro is based on [Claude-3](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) whereas CommunityOne and Wallu are based on the older [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/), so I'm not surprised. Please check it out for yourself:

**https://poe.com/LightningAutofillPro**

Also, good news about Lightning Autofill v12: I think I have ironed out all the bugs and should be able to release it by the end of this weekend! ü•≥ It's a bit delayed from my own initial timeline, but in the grand scheme of things it's still very ahead of schedule considering the MV3 deadline is June.

## Wrapping things up (Apr 27, 2024)

I'm just about ready to publish the new version (v12). As the icing on the cake, I've decided to integrate one big feature for subscribers: the ability to manage their rules from Google Sheets! Since Sheets cannot communicate with browser extensions, you will still have to manually click the **Restore** button to retrieve the latest data from Sheets, but that's still night & day better than the current experience (export CSV, manipulate data in Excel/Sheets, import back into Lightning Autofill).

This is a pretty big feature to add at the last minute, so I may not be able to release by the end of the month, but we'll see. ü§û

## Wallu vs. CommunityOne (Apr 15, 2024)

Yesterday, I discovered another promising ChatGPT-powered helpdesk bot. I've spent most of today comparing `@Wallu - AI` and `@CommunityOne` after training them on the exact same Lightning Autofill documentation. Often I found Wallu's responses more technical and detailed (for example, it sometimes provided code samples), but I felt CommunityOne's responses had more personality. CommunityOne can also reply to more general questions, which makes it more engaging. You can judge for yourself by going to `#‚Å†ask-ai` and ask way -- both bots will respond. Eventually you guys can help me choose between the two of them. üòÅ

## Introducing ‚Å†#ask-ai channel (Apr 13, 2024)

I've just added an experimental customer support AI chatbot called Wallu to help answer questions related to Lightning Autofill. I'm currently training it on [Online Help](https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/help) as well as a few of the channels on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD), so hopefully it will get better over time.

To chat with the bot, head over to the `#‚Å†ask-ai` channel under Support. Try asking it simple questions like "Can I make changes directly in Google Sheets?".

## Firefox blues (Apr 12, 2024)

The most challenging part of the v12 update so far has been trying to get Firefox to NOT break using the same codebase (I do not have the resources to manage two codebases). Starting with MV3 Firefox and Chrome/Edge have diverged in terms of what extension APIs they support, and even what features within the same API that they implement. This has made extensions development very difficult, and I do not rule out ending support for Firefox down the road.

## Lightning Autofill v12 update (Apr 11, 2024)

Hi guys, I'm putting the finishing touches on the major version 12 release. The OAuth app (for the cloud sync feature) is currently going through Google's verification process, which can take over a week. After that, Lightning Autofill will have to go through the extensions review process for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox before the update can get published. If everything goes as planned, expect the big v12 to roll out by the end of this month.

**In the meantime, I recommend you back up all your data to a CSV file using the Import/Export tab.**

## Google Groups is retired -- moving to Discord (Apr 8, 2024)

Hi all, I got too tired of not being able to paste screenshots into [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/chrome-autofill) (among many other annoyances over the years), so I will no longer be maintaining this forum. It will remain online as a reference only.

**Please join the new Discord server for support issues moving forward:**

[https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD](https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD)

Note that it will be quiet for the next week or so as I am super busy trying to get Lightning Autofill v12 ready for the big release.

## HAPPY NEW YEAR! ü•≥ (Feb 10, 2024)

Happy belated New Year everyone (well, I guess it's not belated if we're using the lunar calendar). It has been quite a busy start to the new year for me, with lots of important developments. Let's jump right in...

### Official MV3 timeline

Google has published the latest [Manifest V3 timeline](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3), and it seems that **June 2024** will be the final deadline. This means that Autofill will need to be updated to MV3 before June to remain in the Chrome Store.

Since MV3 extensions cannot evaluate JavaScript code strings, users who have built up a large collection of JS rules might be getting a little nervous. However, fear not, my friends -- I have found a solution that will allow you to keep your JavaScript rules! See the next section for more details.

### Automate ‚Üí Autofill v12

Instead of starting from zero, I have decided to merge Automate into Autofill starting with the next major release, Autofill version 12. This release will have a bunch of exciting changes:

- Update to Manifest V3 (MV3) for future-proofing
- New MV3-compliant JavaScript rules (no need to recreate rules)
- Rebranding from generic Autofill to Lightning Autofill
- New simplified logo
- New cloud sync to Google Sheets
- Rename "Other Stuff" to "Settings" (finally)
- No more banners! (see below)

### New monetization strategy

As many of you know, I left my daytime job to focus on Autofill about one year ago. After considering many different types of monetization options, I settled on the Wikipedia model where Autofill shows a nag screen to encourage users to support the development of Autofill by subscribing. This was completely voluntary. After trying the nag screen for a year, I have come to realize that it isn't working -- the subscriptions barely pay for my rent, and I'm still eating into my savings account every month üòü. Starting with Autofill v12 (Lightning Autofill), I will implement a new three-tier monetization strategy as outlined below:

- Free plan: up to 100 autofills a day (enough for most people)
- Plus plan - $4.99/mo: unlimited autofills a day + cloud sync
- Pro plan - $9.99/mo: unlimited autofills a day + cloud sync + JS rules

As promised, current subscribers will be grandfathered in as follows:

- Monthly subscribers will be converted to the Pro plan at their current $4.99/mo rate (a 50% discount)
- Yearly subscribers will be converted to the Free plan and emailed a 25% discount code off the Plus or Pro plan

After more than 12 years of giving Autofill away for free, I think finally charging for it is only fair. I've considered selling Autofill more than once over the years, but after reading about what happened to [The Great Suspender](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-great-suspender-chrome-extensions-fall-from-grace/), [Hover Zoom](https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom/discussions/670), and [many other extensions](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/malware-vendors-buy-chrome-extensions-to-send-adware-filled-updates/), I don't think I would be able to sleep at night knowing there's even a 1% chance that Autofill would one day be associated with malware.

I'm expecting this change will not be popular, and as a result, there will be a flood of negative reviews when v12 is published. If you do find Lightning Autofill useful, then I would greatly appreciate it if you spared a minute to [leave a positive review](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autofill/nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk/reviews) to balance out all the negative reviews. THANK YOU üôè
