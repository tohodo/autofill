## Need help testing (May 30, 2024)

Hi everyone, since I can't test every form on the internet, I need your help to test my fixes against your forms. If you are having issues autofilling or generating rules, it would be a great help if you could provide me with the following:

1. URL of the form having the issue.
2. Autofill rules for this form (you can export to CSV and attach to email).
3. If necessary, login credentials and exact steps to get to the form and reproduce the issue you are facing.

Please email all this to **tom@tohodo.com**. This way, I can follow the exact steps you are doing to reproduce the issue, then fix the issue for you. Remember that I can only fix what I can reproduce on my system, so please **help me help you**.

### Light at the end of the tunnel

I would like to take this opportunity to point that what many people may not understand is that Lightning Autofill v12 is really Autofill v0.0.1 because I had to make so many fundamental code changes that it's almost like starting from scratch again. It also didn't help that I had to rush to release it by the June deadline, hence there are more bugs than usual. Yes, we may be starting from ground zero, but the most important thing is that Lightning Autofill now complies to Google's [MV3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3) standards and is **future-proof**. Lightning Autofill will only get **better** from here on out. If you give it some time, v12 will eventually surpass v11 in every way. üöÄ

## Rules generator has gone crazy! (May 30, 2024)

A lot of people have notified me that too many rules are being generated now. This is a known regression bug that stems from a fix put in v12.1.0 to address the "No fields have been changed" error many people complained about. In implementing this fix, I made the algorithm too relaxed, so now it picks up a lot of fields that were magically hidden by Lightning Autofill before. This has been fixed in the next release, which will drop soon.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but you should take this opportunity to see just how crazy complex some forms can be -- tons of hidden fields!

## Activation woes (May 29, 2024)

A number of users have reported that they are not able to activate unless they use a VPN service. This is a sign that something is blocking access to the Cloudflare servers used to validate the subscription. What can block the validation servers? It could be your firewall, your company network, your internet service provider, even your country -- it's hard to say. The only solution right now is to use a VPN service. If you don't already have one, then I recommend Windscribe as it's got a very generous free data quota. If you use the link below, then we will both get an extra 1 GB when you sign up.

## Lightning Autofill v12.1.0 released (May 27, 2024)

This update should fix most of the major bugs in v12.0.x. It should be approved for Chrome and Edge soon and roll out to you guys soon. Please test and report back.

**Changelog:**
- Added friendly status message for 400 server error
- Added back import/export text box
- Changed wizard to always generate rules
- Fixed autofill rules not executing in some cases
- Fixed hotkey regression issues
- Improved import/export text box (height is saved)
- Rebuilt infobar in shadow DOM (no more CSS conflicts!)

The next update will focus on improving the Free plan based on the ongoing poll, as well as making the Pro plan more enticing. I'm currently hard at work on trying to enable multi-account Google Sheets for the Pro plan. Stay tuned!

## Version 12 for Chrome postmortem (May 25, 2024)

The release of Lightning Autofill v12 for Chrome was, to put it mildly, quite a challenge. I was ill prepared for the spike in traffic, and the services I employed also struggled under the sudden load. Now that the dust has finally started to settle, I think it's worthwhile to review everything that went wrong in the hopes of avoiding these mistakes in the future. All of the issues that you guys experienced were a result of a perfect storm of the following all converging at the same time that Google released v12 on the Chrome Store:

1. I had recently upgraded from the legacy G Suite plan for my tohodo.com domain to Google Workspace Business to prepare for the increase in email volume. Google Workspace Business allows you to send out 2000 emails per day -- or so I thought. What I didn't realize at the time was that when you start out on the trial period, you are still limited to 100 emails per day. What ended up happening was that after the 100-email quota was used up, the welcome emails stopped going out to new subscribers. That forced me to frantically send out the welcome emails manually one by one. üòÖ
1. Some code was added recently to allow for a trial period. The backend code responsible to determine whether something was a valid trial subscription depended on the text "Trial" in the product description. The problem was that Stripe localizes product descriptions (e.g., "„Éà„É©„Ç§„Ç¢„É´ÊúüÈñì: Lightning Autofill Pro Plan"), so this check failed and invalidated the subscription. This resulted in a bunch of people in non-English countries getting the 400 error when they tried to activate their plan.
1. My domain registrar was bought out by another company, and they chose the exact same time Google released Lightning Autofill v12 to do the domain migration. This resulted in me not receiving any emails to tom@tohodo.com or support@tohodo.com for a time, and emails being sent there were also bouncing. This couldn't have come at a worse time because there were so many support emails that never reached me until much later. In fact, I thought the v12 release was going so smoothly since I wasn't getting as many emails as I did with the v10 and v11 releases. I didn't realize my domain was being migrated until I got an email confirmation from the new registrar, and then the angry emails started coming in soon after. üôà

To avoid a repeat of fiasco 1, I have subscribed to external email services to use as a fallback in case I exceed the daily email quota in the future. Furthermore, once my Workspace Business trial is over, my email limit should be upgraded to 2000 per day. I don't expect fiascos 2 and 3 to repeat themselves again, so we should be good there. Thank you all for your patience and understanding during this launch, and hope you can bear with me as I continue to iron out the remaining bugs within Lightning Autofill itself. üôè

## Lightning Autofill for Chrome finally released (May 23, 2024)

The big day has finally arrived -- Chrome v12 got released. ü•≥ Technically Edge v12 came out first, but that was more like a small appetizer considering Edge only has about 30k users vs Chrome's 1M+ users (Firefox, by comparison, has about 20k users).

This will be a true test to see if there are still outstanding bugs. I expect a sudden influx of new members to the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD) as well. It will be exciting! üï∫

---

## Lightning Autofill v12 for Chrome update (May 22, 2024)

Version 12.0.0 for Chrome was just published, but I had to immediately roll back to v11.9.0 because it has the same issue as the Edge version (wouldn't work unless developer mode was enabled). Since I had to pick a version number larger than 12.0.0 when rolling back, version 12.0.1 is actually v11.9.0. I just published v12.0.6, so hopefully it will get approved a lot sooner than v12.0.0.

Firefox ~~v12.0.0~~ [v12.0.10](https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/changelog.txt) is still under review.

---

## Lightning Autofill v12.0.5 released (May 17, 2024)

This is mainly to fix the issue where the extension breaks if you don't have developer mode enabled.

**Changelog:**
- Added mandatory developer mode notice (MV3 requirement)
- Fixed various developer mode disabled issues

The Chrome and Firefox versions are still under review (as expected, the review process is taking longer than usual).
 
---

## Lightning Autofill v12.0.3 released (May 16, 2024)

This is a hotfix to address some Edge issues that only surfaced after the extension was published (these issues are not reproducible in local testing, hence they were not caught). Changelog:

- Fixed Support and News tabs having no content in Edge
- Fixed "No tab with id" error in some cases
- Removed some unused code from v11

**UPDATE:** After v12.0.3 was released, I was still getting reports of the Options page being blank in Edge even though it was working fine for me. After digging some more, I identified the real root cause: sadly, Chrome and Edge require you to enable Developer mode in order to execute JavaScript rules in MV3:

![image](https://github.com/tohodo/autofill/assets/4110567/d2aeae2a-5a1f-44ea-93bc-ac3658d21663)

This explains why I was not able to reproduce the issue (because I'm always in Developer mode, which is required to develop and test extensions locally). I still can't wrap my head around why they introduced such a silly requirement, but I'll go along with it. I will update both Chrome and Edge versions to add instructions on how to enable Developer mode and republish. Sorry for the troubles! üôè

## üéä Lightning Autofill v12.0.0 released üéâ (May 15, 2024)

After 118 commits over three months, countless improvements, refactoring and bug fixes, Lightning Autofill version 12 has finally been released! It may not look like it on the outside, but underneath this is the biggest release since version 1.0. Let's go over the major changes:

- **Migrated to [Manifest V3 (MV3)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3).** MV2 extensions will be deprecated this June, so this move was unavoidable. Upgrading to MV3 was a royal pain, but it also makes extensions more secure and future-proof. Unfortunately, Mozilla's MV3 implementation is too different from Google's, so Firefox continues to exist as an MV2 add-on until it reaches full MV3 feature parity with Chrome/Edge extensions.
- **Switched to freemium model.** I anticipate this to be an unpopular change after 14 years of being completely free, but it was a necessary change for the continued survival of Lightning Autofill. I've had opportunities to sell this extension in the past, but I read about what can happen to users after an extension is sold ([exhibit A](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-great-suspender-chrome-extensions-fall-from-grace/), [exhibit B](https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom/discussions/670), [exhibit C](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/malware-vendors-buy-chrome-extensions-to-send-adware-filled-updates/)), and didn't want to put you guys at risk, so here we are.
- **Implemented cloud sync.** You can now manage your autofill rules in Google Sheets, which opens up a world of possibilities. I've been meaning to add this feature for years since I manage so much data in Sheets already, and I also automate a lot of workflows with [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/). Unfortunately, there's no way for Google Sheets to communicate with extensions right now, so when you make an edit in Sheets you have to click on the Restore button from Lightning Autofill Options to pull in the changes. Changes in Lightning Autofill are automatically synced to Sheets though.
- **Added support for `autocomplete` attribute.** This was a small change with big implications. Since [this attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) has become so prevalent, you now have the capability to create more reliable global address rules. In fact, Lightning Autofill v12 comes with sample address rules that you can modify for your own needs. For existing users who are updating to v12, you can import the address rules using remote import from this URL: https://pastebin.com/raw/Rk42q0cv (NOTE: remember to choose the "Append" option or these rules will overwrite your existing rules).
- You can see the full list of changes in the [changelog](https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/changelog.txt).

Since so much of the code was rewritten, and the extension migrated from MV2 to MV3, I expect the review process to be longer than usual, possibly over a week, so hang on tight. I'll post another announcement when it's published and starts rolling out to Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

### How to activate your plan

Once Lightning Autofill has been updated to v12, you will see a new **Subscription** section in **Options ‚Üí Settings**:

![image](https://github.com/tohodo/autofill/assets/4110567/8762fecb-fd7f-4c10-a72b-b52e9588d2d0)

This is where you enter the invoice number to activate your subscription plan.

### Bye bye, Wallu

After monitoring the `#ask-ai` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD) for awhile, it's clear that the CommunityOne bot gives consistently better quality responses than Wallu AI. Hence, I will give Wallu early retirement and keep only CommunityOne in the channel. Having two bots answer at the same time can be confusing as well, so this is a good change.

### Hello, LightningAutofillPro

Even though we have the `#ask-ai` channel, the best helpdesk chatbot is actually the one I trained on Poe: [LightningAutofillPro](https://poe.com/LightningAutofillPro). I recommend everyone consult with LightningAutofillPro for the following reasons:

- It's private. Everybody can see what you ask in the `#ask-ai` channel, so if you want to ask about something personal or confidential, then ask LightningAutofillPro.
- It's based on a newer, better LLM. CommunityOne is powered by [GPT-3.5](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/). LightningAutofillPro is powered by [Claude-3](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family), which is generally better across the board.
- Your chat sessions are saved. Once you register for a free account, you will have a history of everything that you ever asked LightningAutofillPro.
- You can bookmark it. No need to be logged into Discord.

## Introducing LightningAutofillPro Poe bot (May 11, 2024)

I just created my first bot on Poe, and after lots of testing it seems to provide [superior responses](https://poe.com/s/BPEpOlsTWvmfEcn1FjY9) to both CommunityOne and Wallu AI Discord bots. LightningAutofillPro is based on [Claude-3](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family) whereas CommunityOne and Wallu are based on the older [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/), so I'm not surprised. Please check it out for yourself:

**https://poe.com/LightningAutofillPro**

Also, good news about Lightning Autofill v12: I think I have ironed out all the bugs and should be able to release it by the end of this weekend! ü•≥ It's a bit delayed from my own initial timeline, but in the grand scheme of things it's still very ahead of schedule considering the MV3 deadline is June.

---

## Wrapping things up (Apr 27, 2024)

I'm just about ready to publish the new version (v12). As the icing on the cake, I've decided to integrate one big feature for subscribers: the ability to manage their rules from Google Sheets! Since Sheets cannot communicate with browser extensions, you will still have to manually click the **Restore** button to retrieve the latest data from Sheets, but that's still night & day better than the current experience (export CSV, manipulate data in Excel/Sheets, import back into Lightning Autofill).

This is a pretty big feature to add at the last minute, so I may not be able to release by the end of the month, but we'll see. ü§û

## Wallu vs. CommunityOne (Apr 15, 2024)

Yesterday, I discovered another promising ChatGPT-powered helpdesk bot. I've spent most of today comparing `@Wallu - AI` and `@CommunityOne` after training them on the exact same Lightning Autofill documentation. Often I found Wallu's responses more technical and detailed (for example, it sometimes provided code samples), but I felt CommunityOne's responses had more personality. CommunityOne can also reply to more general questions, which makes it more engaging. You can judge for yourself by going to `#‚Å†ask-ai` and ask way -- both bots will respond. Eventually you guys can help me choose between the two of them. üòÅ

---

## Introducing ‚Å†#ask-ai channel (Apr 13, 2024)

I've just added an experimental customer support AI chatbot called Wallu to help answer questions related to Lightning Autofill. I'm currently training it on [Online Help](https://www.tohodo.com/autofill/help) as well as a few of the channels on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD), so hopefully it will get better over time.

To chat with the bot, head over to the `#‚Å†ask-ai` channel under Support. Try asking it simple questions like "Can I make changes directly in Google Sheets?".

---

## Firefox blues (Apr 12, 2024)

The most challenging part of the v12 update so far has been trying to get Firefox to NOT break using the same codebase (I do not have the resources to manage two codebases). Starting with MV3 Firefox and Chrome/Edge have diverged in terms of what extension APIs they support, and even what features within the same API that they implement. This has made extensions development very difficult, and I do not rule out ending support for Firefox down the road.

---

## Lightning Autofill v12 update (Apr 11, 2024)

Hi guys, I'm putting the finishing touches on the major version 12 release. The OAuth app (for the cloud sync feature) is currently going through Google's verification process, which can take over a week. After that, Lightning Autofill will have to go through the extensions review process for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox before the update can get published. If everything goes as planned, expect the big v12 to roll out by the end of this month.

**In the meantime, I recommend you back up all your data to a CSV file using the Import/Export tab.**

---

## Google Groups is retired -- moving to Discord (Apr 8, 2024)

Hi all, I got too tired of not being able to paste screenshots into [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/chrome-autofill) (among many other annoyances over the years), so I will no longer be maintaining this forum. It will remain online as a reference only.

**Please join the new Discord server for support issues moving forward:**

[https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD](https://discord.gg/NY6xxsQBRD)

Note that it will be quiet for the next week or so as I am super busy trying to get Lightning Autofill v12 ready for the big release.

---

## HAPPY NEW YEAR! ü•≥ (Feb 10, 2024)

Happy belated New Year everyone (well, I guess it's not belated if we're using the lunar calendar). It has been quite a busy start to the new year for me, with lots of important developments. Let's jump right in...

### Official MV3 timeline

Google has published the latest [Manifest V3 timeline](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/resuming-the-transition-to-mv3), and it seems that **June 2024** will be the final deadline. This means that Autofill will need to be updated to MV3 before June to remain in the Chrome Store.

Since MV3 extensions cannot evaluate JavaScript code strings, users who have built up a large collection of JS rules might be getting a little nervous. However, fear not, my friends -- I have found a solution that will allow you to keep your JavaScript rules! See the next section for more details.

### Automate ‚Üí Autofill v12

Instead of starting from zero, I have decided to merge Automate into Autofill starting with the next major release, Autofill version 12. This release will have a bunch of exciting changes:

- Update to Manifest V3 (MV3) for future-proofing
- New MV3-compliant JavaScript rules (no need to recreate rules)
- Rebranding from generic Autofill to Lightning Autofill
- New simplified logo
- New cloud sync to Google Sheets
- Rename "Other Stuff" to "Settings" (finally)
- No more banners! (see below)

### New monetization strategy

As many of you know, I left my daytime job to focus on Autofill about one year ago. After considering many different types of monetization options, I settled on the Wikipedia model where Autofill shows a nag screen to encourage users to support the development of Autofill by subscribing. This was completely voluntary. After trying the nag screen for a year, I have come to realize that it isn't working -- the subscriptions barely pay for my rent, and I'm still eating into my savings account every month üòü. Starting with Autofill v12 (Lightning Autofill), I will implement a new three-tier monetization strategy as outlined below:

- Free plan: up to 100 autofills a day (enough for most people)
- Plus plan - $4.99/mo: unlimited autofills a day + cloud sync
- Pro plan - $9.99/mo: unlimited autofills a day + cloud sync + JS rules

As promised, current subscribers will be grandfathered in as follows:

- Monthly subscribers will be converted to the Pro plan at their current $4.99/mo rate (a 50% discount)
- Yearly subscribers will be converted to the Free plan and emailed a 25% discount code off the Plus or Pro plan

After more than 12 years of giving Autofill away for free, I think finally charging for it is only fair. I've considered selling Autofill more than once over the years, but after reading about what happened to [The Great Suspender](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-great-suspender-chrome-extensions-fall-from-grace/), [Hover Zoom](https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom/discussions/670), and [many other extensions](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/malware-vendors-buy-chrome-extensions-to-send-adware-filled-updates/), I don't think I would be able to sleep at night knowing there's even a 1% chance that Autofill would one day be associated with malware.

I'm expecting this change will not be popular, and as a result, there will be a flood of negative reviews when v12 is published. If you do find Lightning Autofill useful, then I would greatly appreciate it if you spared a minute to [leave a positive review](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autofill/nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk/reviews) to balance out all the negative reviews. THANK YOU üôè
